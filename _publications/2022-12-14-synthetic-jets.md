The present experimental study focuses on analyzing the heat transfer characteristics and understanding the axis switching phenomenon for impinging elliptic jets with high aspect ratios. The hot-wire anemometry is used to study the flow characteristics of synthetic jet, while heat transfer characteristics are studied by using a thermal imaging technique. The heat transfer characteristics of elliptical orifices with aspect ratios 10 & 14 are being studied and compared to an equivalent circular orifice. Results show that in the near-field region (z/d < 3), the average Nusselt number of elliptical orifices (AR = 10 & 14) is obtained to be higher than the circular counterpart. However, with the rise of AR from 10 to 14, thermal performance of elliptical orifices decreases in the near-field region. In the intermediate and far-field region, the thermal performance of such elliptical orifices depreciates, since most of the momentum of the…
