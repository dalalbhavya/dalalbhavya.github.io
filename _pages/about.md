As a passionate enthusiast of autonomous vehicles and robotics, I am committed to leveraging my skills and knowledge to drive innovation in the automation and automotive industries. Currently, in my final year of a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, I have gained hands-on experience through various projects and internships.

Through my previous works I'm familiar with the various tasks of 3D perception for self-driving cars. I also have experience working with manipulator arms, where I've worked on optimizing the trajectory and improving its depth perception. All of these give me a good understanding of perception, planning, and control systems.

Equipped with skills in programming languages like Python and C++, and experience with frameworks like ROS, PyTorch, I am well-versed in bringing robots to life. I also possess a strong foundation in mechanical engineering principles, that enables me to design and develop robust systems.
